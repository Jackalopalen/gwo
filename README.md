# xivcraft
Repo

This is a tool I created to assist with crafting in FFXIV: A Realm Reborn.
It is similar to the shopping cart found at xivdb.com, but slightly more robust (and probably more prone to bugs since I have no idea what I am doing)
This is my first attempt at constructing a GUI, I guess it's my first proper "program" (if you can call it that).

Like on xivdb, you select some crafting recipes and the tool will tell you the ingredients required.
Unlike xivdb, however, there is no limit on how many recipes you can select at once.
Also, the tool will provide tree diagrams if the ingredients themselves can be crafted.

To use, download the files and run 'FFXIV Crafting Tool.pyw'
Python 2.7 is required. I assume it won't work with Python 3.

Within the tool, select a class, level range, or just type in the name of the item to craft, and the results will appear below.
Select one or more result and click the '+' button (or double click) to add to the Make List.
Ingredients will appear in the box above.
Select one or more item in the Make List and click the '-' button (or double click) to remove it.

The tool is a work in progress, I will improve it as I feel like it.
Feel free to make your own adjustments as you see fit.

The recipe and ingredient lists I am using come from http://www.gameskinny.com/27qul/just-ashleys-final-fantasy-xiv-guides-current-and-upcoming-listed
Without Ashley SSS putting the lists together with the tedious work, I'm sure I'd never have done so.
Thank you.
